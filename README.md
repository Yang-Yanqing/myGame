## 🎮 Features  

- **Innovative Time Axis & Coordinate System**  
  Custom-built TimeAxis and CoordSys decouple real time from game time, making gameplay smoother and paving the way for future iterations.  

- **Weapon Drop Mechanism**  
  Every 50 points rewards the player with a temporary weapon, adding freshness and replay value.  

- **Robustness**  
  Game state (bullets, enemies, bosses) is fully cleared on Game Over, ensuring a clean restart without bugs.  

- **Business-Oriented Thinking**  
  This version already lays the groundwork for a membership unlock system: in the future, with database and payment integration, players will be able to recharge and unlock powerful hidden weapons.  
  *Meaningful code is code that delivers value.*
